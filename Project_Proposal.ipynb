    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains our project proposal for CPSC 322. The objective is to analyze a multi-country dataset that links water quality/pollution indicators with the incidence of waterborne diseases, and to build predictive models that identify which water source types (e.g., river, well, tap, pond) and other environmental / socio-economic factors are most strongly associated with high contaminant or metal levels and elevated disease rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will produce an exploratory data analysis, feature engineering pipeline, and classification/regression models to (1) predict high contaminant/metal levels and (2) identify important predictors, with a particular focus on water source type."

    "**Overview:** The dataset explores the relationship between water pollution indicators and prevalence of waterborne diseases from 2000 to 2025 for a selection of countries and regions. It contains water quality measures (contaminant and metal concentrations, bacterial indicators), access and sanitation metrics, water source types, treatment methods, disease incidence rates (e.g., diarrhea, cholera, typhoid), and socio-economic indicators.\n",

    "**Primary target(s) we will predict / analyze:**\n",
    "1. **High contaminant presence (binary classification):** A binary label indicating whether any measured contaminant/metal exceeds a health-based threshold (e.g., WHO guideline). We will create this label by applying domain thresholds to contaminant columns (e.g., arsenic > 10 µg/L).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Disease incidence (regression or classification):** Predict disease rates (e.g., diarrhea cases per 1000) or a derived binary label indicating `high_disease_burden` above an empirically chosen threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the core deliverable, we will prioritize the *High contaminant presence* classification mapped from contaminant/metal levels and then analyze how water source type and other features contribute to predicting that label."

    "## 3. Implementation / Technical approach\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will follow these major steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data ingestion & cleaning** — load CSV(s) with `pandas`, inspect missingness, unify units (e.g., µg/L vs mg/L), and create derived variables (e.g., `any_contaminant_exceeds_WHO`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)** — distribution of variables, per-country and per-source summaries, time trends, and visualization of contaminant levels by water source type.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Preprocessing pipeline** — using `scikit-learn` `Pipeline` and `ColumnTransformer` for:\n",
    "- Imputation (mean/median for numeric; most frequent for categorical; model-based for complex cases)\n",
    "- Scaling (RobustScaler / StandardScaler for numeric)\n",
    "- Encoding (OneHotEncoder or Target encoding for high-cardinality categoricals)\n",
    "- Feature engineering (e.g., combining contaminants into a `contaminant_index`)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Feature selection & dimensionality reduction** — see section below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Modeling** — baseline and more advanced models for classification and regression:\n",
    "- Baselines: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree\n",
    "- Ensembles: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost / LightGBM)\n",
    "- Calibrated probability models if needed\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Evaluation** — appropriate metrics and validation strategy:\n",
    "- Classification: precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC; if class imbalance exists, consider PR-AUC and class-weighting\n",
    "- Regression (if used): RMSE, MAE, R²\n",
    "- Cross-validation: time-aware split (if temporal autocorrelation) or stratified K-fold on region/country.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Interpretation / explainability** — feature importances, SHAP values, partial dependence plots to quantify the relationship between `water_source_type` and risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Reporting & reproducibility** — generate reproducible notebook, document preprocessing steps, and place code + dataset in GitHub repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Libraries planned:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`/`seaborn` (for plotting), `scikit-learn`, `xgboost` or `lightgbm`, `shap` for explanation."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data quality / missing values**\n",
    "- Missing contaminant readings for some regions/years or for certain water sources.\n",
    "- Mixed units (e.g., mg/L vs µg/L) requiring normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Label construction choices**\n",
    "- Choosing thresholds for \"high\" contaminant levels can be non-trivial. We will rely on WHO/US EPA guidelines and document our choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class imbalance**\n",
    "- \"High contaminant\" events may be relatively rare. We'll consider resampling (SMOTE), class-weighted losses, or threshold tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Temporal and spatial correlation**\n",
    "- Observations from the same country/region/year are not i.i.d. We will use grouped cross-validation or time-based splits to avoid over-optimistic estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Heterogeneous data types and high cardinality**\n",
    "- High-cardinality categorical variables (e.g., many `water_source_subtypes`) may require target encoding or embedding approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Confounding socio-economic variables**\n",
    "- Socio-economic factors (GDP, healthcare access) may confound relationships between water source type and disease. We'll include them as covariates and use interpretable models/SHAP to identify conditional effects."

    "- **Filter methods:** Correlation analysis and univariate feature selection (ANOVA, mutual information) to remove near-zero variance and uninformative features.\n",

    "- **Tree-based importances:** Train a Random Forest / LightGBM and rank features by importance.\n",
